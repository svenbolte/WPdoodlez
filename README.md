### Quizzz

Quizzz supports categories images and integrates them in single and header if used in theme

## Why this fork?
the main project was not updated for years now. I needed some features and added them to the project.
Completed the german and german formal translations. Added method to use structure for polls (only one answer allowed)
Added quiz custom post type "question" to make a 4 answers and single answer quiz with results certificate. questions can be played as hangman, when answer ist suitable

WPDoodlez can be password protected (with builtin wordpress logic) to prevent others seeing the content
Archives, Post Content, Post-Thumbnail, Categories and Tags have been enabled to provide full integration like a normal post.

Quiz game has a shortcode for random questions and a custom post type "question" for quiz. It can display a certificate to print
and stores your ranking in a personal cookie. personal rankings are only stored in your browser, not the web server and only if you allow comfort cookies

## Shortcode
[wpdoodlez_sc id=post-ID chart=true] set post ID to integrate Doodlez or Poll in other pages, set chart to false if you do not want pie graph

## Details
Based on Wordpress custom types. Rich text, media, comments and categories can 
be a part of every polling. Voting options comes from custom fields (in post 
editor under the text editing field) and the first value of every given custom 
field will be shown as user answer. (Multiple answers are possible)
For example: Custom field name is *Monday*, the value *I like mondays*. The 
column name will be "Monday" and every person voted on monday have in the row
unter *Monday* *I like mondays*. If not voted on Monday the cell will be empty.

Every person can vote once. Used name will be stored in a cookie for 30 days. 
Every person can change only own voting if the cookie is still in the browser.

Administrators and editors can delete every vote (but not the cookie on the 
browser).
